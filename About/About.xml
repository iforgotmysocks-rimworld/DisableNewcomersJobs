v1.0.0

A small qol mod allowing you to configure jobs, which u'd rather see disabled for new pawns joining your colony. Being suprised by 10 additional pawns provided by some quest, all eagier to show of their lv 4 doctoring skills during the next heart surgery, or cooking the most excellent meals poisoning the entire colony with their lv 3 knowledge of food preparation.

Doesn't do anything without configuration, so open up the mod settings after installation and configure freely which jobs u want disabled for new pawns and at which level treshhold. New pawn's jobs will be adjusted after a few seconds on the map.
